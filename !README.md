# Math-Modeling-Pr4
Run each file for their respective purposes, as described in the file name.

For all files starting with the name math_modeling_pr_4, the output xsim shows the optimal production levels, and the output fvalsim shows the negative of the maximized profit. These files are specific to each of the 6 questions Fashion Star asked us to answer. Sensitivity is calculated by multiplying the relevant portion(s) of the code by 1 plus or minus the percent sensitivity of interest.

For the two sensitivity-specific files, xvec shows the optimal production levels, and fval shows the maximized profit. The Project_4_sensitivity file was semi-independently created to verify the correctness of the math_modeling_pr4 files. The Proj4_Sensitivity_CombModel has a notable addition of cashmere scarves, since it was used to run the model with the combined, final recommendations.
